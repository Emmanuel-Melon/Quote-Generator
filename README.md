# Quote-Generator
Random quote generator which constructs quotes by assembling different pieces of a sentence.  
## Objectives: This app will be built in two steps  
### Step 1:  
- [ ] The quotes are generated randomly one by one with each JavaScript call  
- [ ] Each quote is a combination of at least 3 sentence fragments (it's up to you to create these sentence fragments: beginning, middle, and end)  
- [ ] The quotes should be relatively coherent (no exclamation points in the middle of a sentence, for example)  

### Step 2:
- [ ] Select the number of quotes generated (between 1 and 5)  
- [ ] Choose between 2 types of quote generators (accordingly, you'll need two different sets of sentences)  
- [ ] Once the quotes are generated, have the program generate new quotes or quit the program
