View demo [Quotation Generator](https://emmanuel-melon.github.io/Quote-Generator/)   
## Setup  
- Clone the repository by running `git clone`  
- Navigate to `Quote-Generator`  
- run `npm start`  
- App will open in `http://localhost:8080`  
## Objectives: This app will be built in two steps  
### Step 1:  
- [x] The quotes are generated randomly one by one with each JavaScript call  
- [x] Each quote is a combination of at least 3 sentence fragments (it's up to you to create these sentence fragments: beginning, middle, and end)  
- [x] The quotes should be relatively coherent (no exclamation points in the middle of a sentence, for example)  

### Step 2:
- [x] Select the number of quotes generated (between 1 and 5)  
- [x] Choose between 2 types of quote generators (accordingly, you'll need two different sets of sentences)  
- [x] Once the quotes are generated, have the program generate new quotes or quit the program
