### Running Locally

### Hosted Version

This app is currently hosted on [Quotation Generator](https://emmanuel-melon.github.io/Quote-Generator/)

## Objectives: This app will be built in two steps

### Step 1:

- [x] The quotes are generated randomly one by one with each JavaScript call
- [x] Each quote is a combination of at least 3 sentence fragments (it's up to you to create these sentence fragments: beginning, middle, and end)
- [x] The quotes should be relatively coherent (no exclamation points in the middle of a sentence, for example)

### Step 2:

- [x] Select the number of quotes generated (between 1 and 5)
- [x] Choose between 2 types of quote generators (accordingly, you'll need two different sets of sentences)
- [x] Once the quotes are generated, have the program generate new quotes or quit the program
