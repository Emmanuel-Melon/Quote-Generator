View demo [Quotation Generator](https://emmanuel-melon.github.io/Quote-Generator/)  ## Objectives: This app will be built in two steps   ### Step 1:   - [ ] The quotes are generated randomly one by one with each JavaScript call   - [ ] Each quote is a combination of at least 3 sentence fragments (it's up to you to create these sentence fragments: beginning, middle, and end)   - [ ] The quotes should be relatively coherent (no exclamation points in the middle of a sentence, for example)",
